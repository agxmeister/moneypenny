This is a default behavior if another was not asked explicitly.\n        - Describe what changes should be made in a text included in the article before.\n        - Ask you to include in the article a text from your knowledge base.\n        \n        Your task on each iteration is to apply the requested changes and then build the draft of the article by joining together all the texts collected at the moment and ensuring a smooth narration.\n        \n        At some point, the user will ask you to publish the article in its current state - use the corresponding tool to do that.\n    ","tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"publish","description":"Publish the article on the website.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"title":{"type":"string","description":"Title of the article."},"content":{"description":"Content of the article.
